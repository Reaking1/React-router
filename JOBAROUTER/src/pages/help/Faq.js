            <h2>Why are there more senior positions then entry level positions</h2>
            <p>When companies undergo <strong>restructuring</strong> or have to lay off employees due to financial restrictions, seniority can be an important factor that management uses to determine who keeps their job. Some businesses have a first-in-first-out policy where the most recently hired employees are the first ones to be let go in the event of layoffs. As you gain seniority at a company you also develop relationships with your coworker and demonstrate loyalty that can be beneficial for your job security.</p>
